# Notes API built with CodeIgniter and Red Bean ORM

This API has been built to feed a Notes React app, where I will experiment with React Hooks and the Context API. I will link to the app here when it is ready.

Building this API has enabled me to better understand how other frameworks (besides Laravel) give you the tools to build REST APIs. 

## What have I learned?

* How to integrate RedBean ORM (and other 3rd party libraries) with CodeIgniter 
* How to setup a REST API with CodeIgniter
* How to replicate Laravel's fillables functionality
* How to create one-to-many relationships with RedBean
* How to set up form validation

## What is next?

* Separate validation code from controllers with validation class
* Added date/time stamps to notes
